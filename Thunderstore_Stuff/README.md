The Mod logs every player in the leaderboard and your friends/recent list and writes their BP amount into a file.

## Controls and Other Functions
- If a player is not in the list yet they will be added to the end of the list.
- If a player is already in the lest their BP value will be adjusted.
- The name of all players will get sanitized to remove the hex color codes.
- The mod doesn't continously log the mentioned lists. The logging only gets triggered by the actions mentioned below.
### leaderboard
- Logging gets triggered by entering the gym because the value only updates when you enter the gym.
### Recent Players
- To Log the players in your recent players list, open the recent players board with the lever.
### Friend list
- To Log the players in your friends list press on of the scroll buttons (the 4 buttons to the left).

## Known Issues
- Using "<#" without following it by ">" will mess up your name in the logs after that usage.
